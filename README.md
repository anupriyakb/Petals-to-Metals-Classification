# Petals-to-Metals-Classification
This project is a Multi class image classification model on Petals to metals datasets which is in TFRecord format. The network was trained on various models like Xception and VGG19,InceptionV3 and after fine-tuning and evaluating the performance on all three models, our best performing model achieved 0.83% accuracy with DenseNet201 model with transfer learning.
